# traffic_sign_classification

## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing and classifying traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify various traffic signs from images, which can be useful for applications such as autonomous driving and traffic monitoring.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. You can download it from Kaggle:
